## Section 1 - Fundamentals of Cognitive Computing
#### 1.1. Define the main characteristics of a cognitive system.

- Cognitive systems understand, reason and learn 
 - Must understand structured and unstructured data 
 - Must reason by prioritizing recommendations and ability to form hypothesis 
 - Learns iteratively by repeated training as it build smarter patterns 
- Cognitive systems are here to augment human knowledge not replace it 
- Cognitive systems employ machine learning technologies 
 - Supervised learning versus unsupervised learning 
- Cognitive systems use natural language processing 

#### 1.2 Explain neural nets.

Neurons are the basic unit of a neural network. In nature, neurons have a number of dendrites (inputs), a cell nucleus (processor) and an axon (output). When the neuron activates, it accumulates all its incoming inputs, and if it goes over a certain threshold it fires a signal thru the axon.. sort of. The important thing about neurons is that they can learn.

Artificial neurons look more like this:
